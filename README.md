# AssemblyLine_Application

This was my final project for semester 3. In this we have to create a assembly line where customer's order are processed according to their requirement. 
The entire project is build with the help of core concepts. Every class has it's own work in completing the given task. Moreover, I have not used a single manual 
loop every looping is made with the help of algorithms. To store customer's data i have used container because they easy to expand and have certain features that
delivers the work in more effcient way.
